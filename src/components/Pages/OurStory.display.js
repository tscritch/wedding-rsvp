        Tad and Eden began their long distance friendship in the fall of 2016. Eden was visiting her friend Anna Myers’ home in Fresno, California, and she caught Tad’s eye.
        They would both agree that the first real conversation they had with each other sparked an interest, and they knew they were meant to be in each other’s lives to some capacity.
        By exchanging snap chat handles, their connection after parting from that short October weekend didn’t dissipate. It only got stronger.<br /><br />
        After 9 months of friendship and many FaceTime chats later, Tad decided to step out and ask Eden on some dates! “I want to treat you to a weekend of dates, and you won’t have to lift a finger. I’ll take care of it all!”
        Eden obliged, and just a few weekends later on June 8th, Eden was swooned with fancy dinners, sunset hikes, sunflowers and aquariums. Thus began their love story.<br /><br />
        With Eden in Arizona and Tad in California, they spent 6 months long distance. During this time, they prayed and sought the Lord together in anticipation for Tad finding a job in Phoenix to continue his pursuit of Eden. In between classes, countless job applications, health troubles, and distance, their relationship was not all roses, but they knew it was something worth fighting for.
        Finally, on December 8th, Eden got the call from Tad while walking back from class that Digital Airstrike has offered him a job!!! Tears of joy came to them as they knew God had ordained something extremely special for their future. This was the beginning of something beautiful. <br /><br />
        Tad’s new job welcomed him on January 2nd, and he knew this place was a great fit for him. With Eden still in school, it was a roller coaster of fun, transition, and change to learn how to balance this new life God has blessed them with!
        On June 8th of 2018, Tad proposed to Eden in the spot where they first kissed and shared a sweet moment together, and it was now marked as the spot he popped the question! With white flowers and candles at his parents property in the mountains, Eden said YES!<br /><br />
        As the months have gone by, it is no doubt the grace and favor that has been on their relationship. From promotions in both of their jobs, opened doors they couldn’t imagine, families meeting and loving each other and more, they are incredibly excited to share their big day with YOU!
